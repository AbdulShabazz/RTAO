# RTAO

This is an implementation of Ray Traced Ambient Occlusion (RTAO) using DXR. Code is based on a **IntroToDXR Project** ( github.com/acmarrs/IntroToDXR ) by Adam Marrs - you should check it out for build instructions and code description.

## How it works

RTAO is meant as a replacement for typical SSAO effects found in many rendering engines, and therefore is implemented in a similar way. It is executed as a post-processing effect in two passes, which are separate from the main geometry rendering pass:
 1. **AO raytracing pass** - uses normals and depth from main rendering pass to reconstruct world space position of visible pixels, and shoots AO rays in a normal-oriented hemisphere from there.
 2. **Filtering pass** - applies temporal filter (box filter) and spatial low-pass filter (gaussian blur) on a noisy result from previous pass
  
AO raytracing pass simply shoots selected number of AO rays, using directions from a pre-calculated sample-set. It uses basic temporal accumulation and filtering - AO is stored for a few previous frames in a cache. Cached values are first aligned with current frame using reverse reprojection (which requires motion vectors from a renderer). A filtering pass then applies a box filter on cached values, and a spatial filter to smooth out the results.
 

## Where to go from now

This is a basic implementation that can (and should) be improved! Try this:

 - Calculate AO in a 'main pass' - if you're using ray tracing for primary rays, you can add secondary AO rays directly to it, avoiding the need to execute another pass specifically for AO - make sure however to use simple closest-hit shader for AO rays, that does not load any materials and uses simple payload structure (just the *T* distance).
 - Implement downsampling - AO can be calculated in a lower resolution than main image. Make sure to execute filtering pass in full resolution to preserve sharpness on geometry edges (prevent unpleasant halo artifacts). Try adding dithering to the low-resolution result to reduce some of the "blockiness"
 - Adaptive sampling - use less samples in a great distance or in dark image areas.
 - Better sample-sets - find sample-sets that yield better visual results, take a look at interleaved sampling
 - Better filtering approaches - both temporal and spatial filters can be adjusted and tuned for specific scenes - dynamic scenes may not like the temporal approaches, but movement will hide noise better.
